OS IMPORTANT QUESTIONS FOR IA2

THIRD UNIT:

Process Synchronization->
1) What is critical Section Problem ? Explain the requirements of the same(IA/SEE).
2) Explain Peterson's Solution for critical section Problem with algorithm(IA/SEE)
3) Explain Semaphore implementation to solve critical section problem(IA/SEE)
4) Classical Problems of Synchronization:
	a) Bounded Buffer Problem(Generally asked in SEE)
	b) Reader-Writer Problem(Generally asked in SEE)
	c) Dining philosophers Problem with structure(Most Important for IA/SEE)


Deadlocks->
1) Deadlock Characterisation(Generally asked in SEE)
2) Resource allocation Graph
3) Methods for handling deadlocks-> There are 3 methods(Asked for 10M in SEE)
4) Bankers Algorithm (Imp for both IA/SEE)
	a) If asked in IA just solve problem
	b) If asked in SEE explaination + problem


FOURTH UNIT:

Main Memory->
1) Explain Process Of swapping(Compulsory Question for IA/SEE)
2) Multiple partition Allocation Best fit,First fit & worst fit (Not imp for IA but most imp For SEE)
3) What is Paging? Explain Paging Hardware with TLB with diagram(IA/SEE)


Virtual Memory ->
1) Page Replacement Algorithms(IMP for IA/SEE)
2) Explain demand paging(Generally asked for 3-4 Marks in SEE)
3) What is Page Fault?What are steps to handle Page Fault.Explain with diagram(Compulsory Question for    IA/SEE)
4) Problems on FIFO or Optimal or LRU algorithms
   NO theory will be asked regarding the algorithms.
